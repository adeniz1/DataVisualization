# DataVisualization with d3.js

An interactive data visualization project created using D3.js, as part of a university module. The visualization showcases data analysis in an intuitive and interactive format, allowing users to explore and gain insights from the dataset.

## Introduction
This project was developed to visualize student performance in exams for two courses. The dataset includes information on grades, number of attempts, scores, and whether students passed or failed. The visualization aims to reveal differences between students who passed and those who did not, providing insights into performance patterns across the courses. Using D3.js, the interactive interface allows users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively.

## Features 
- Interactive charts and graphs to visualize the dataset.
- Hover effects to display additional information.
- Dynamic filtering and sorting options for easier data exploration.

## Technologies
- D3.js: For building the data-driven visualizations.
- HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web page.
- JavaScript: For interactivity and logic implementation.
- Node.js: For running a local development server.
